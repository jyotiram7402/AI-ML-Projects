As this article was being written, the founder of a London technology company messaged your correspondent unprompted to say that this kind of AI is âessentially all Iâm thinking about these daysâ.

Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia have all trained their own LLM s, and given them names like P a LM , Megatron, Titan and Chinchilla. Running alongside this excitement is deep concern , inside the tech industry and beyond, that generativemodels are being developed too quickly.-4 is a type of generativecalled a large language model ().

      "The lure grows greater\n",
      "\n",
      "The London tech boss says he is âincredibly nervous about the existential threatâ posed by AI , even as he pursues it, and is âspeaking with [other] founders about it dailyâ. Governments in America, Europe and China have all started mulling new regulations. Prominent voices are calling for the development of artificial intelligence to be paused, lest the software somehow run out of control and damage, or even destroy, human society. To calibrate how worried or excited you should be about this technology, it helps first to understand where it came from, how it works and what the limits are to its growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contemporary explosion of the capabilities of AI software began in the early 2010s, when a software technique called âdeep learningâ became popular. Using the magic mix of vast datasets and powerful computers running neural networks on Graphics Processing Units ( GPU s), deep learning dramatically improved computersâ abilities to recognise images, process audio and play games. By the late 2010s computers could do many of these tasks better than any human.\n",
      "\n",
      "But neural networks tended to be embedded in software with broader functionality, like email clients, and non-coders rarely interacted with these AI s directly. Those that did often described their experience in near-spiritual terms. Lee Sedol, one of the worldâs best players of Go, an ancient Chinese board game, retired from the game after Alphabetâs neural-net-based AlphaGo software crushed him in 2016. âEven if I become the number one,â he said, âthere is an entity that cannot be defeated.â\n",
      "\n",
      "By working in the most human of mediums, conversation, Chat GPT is now allowing the internet-using public to experience something similar, a kind of intellectual vertigo caused by software which has improved suddenly to the point where it can perform tasks that had been exclusively in the domain of human intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite that feeling of magic, an LLM is, in reality, a giant exercise in statistics. Prompt Chat GPT to finish the sentence: âThe promise of large language models is that theyâ¦â and you will get an immediate response. How does it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the language of the query is converted from words, which neural networks cannot handle, into a representative set of numbers (see graphic). GPT -3, which powered an earlier version of Chat GPT , does this by splitting text into chunks of characters, called tokens, which commonly occur together. These tokens can be words, like âloveâ or âareâ, affixes, like âdisâ or âisedâ, and punctuation, like â?â. GPT -3âs dictionary contains details of 50,257 tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tokenisation Theââ 464 ââpromiseââ 6991 ââofââ 286 ââlargeââ 1588 ââlanguageââ 3303 ââmodelsââ 4981 ââisââ 318 ââthatââ 326 ââtheyââ 484\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT -3 is able to process a maximum of 2,048 tokens at a time, which is around the length of a long article in The Economist. GPT -4, by contrast, can handle inputs up to 32,000 tokens longâa novella. The more text the model can take in, the more context it can see, and the better its answers will be. There is a catchâthe required computation rises non-linearly with the length of the input, meaning slightly longer inputs need much more computing power.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tokens are then assigned the equivalent of definitions by placing them into a âmeaning spaceâ where words that have similar meanings are located in nearby areas.\n",

      "\n",
      "The LLM then deploys its âattention networkâ to make connections between different parts of the prompt. Someone reading our prompt, âthe promise of large language models is that theyâ¦â, would know how English grammar works and understand the concepts behind the words in the sentence. It would be obvious to them which words relate to each otherâit is the model that is large, for example. An LLM , however, must learn these associations from scratch during its training phaseâover billions of training runs, its attention network slowly encodes the structure of the language it sees as numbers (called âweightsâ) within its neural network. If it understands language at all, an LLM only does so in a statistical, rather than a grammatical, way. It is much more like an abacus than it is like a mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the prompt has been processed, the LLM initiates a response. At this point, for each of the tokens in the modelâs vocabulary, the attention network has produced a probability of that token being the most appropriate one to use next in the sentence it is generating. The token with the highest probability score is not always the one chosen for the responseâhow the LLM makes this choice depends on how creative the model has been told to be by its operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LLM generates a word and then feeds the result back into itself. The first word is generated based on the prompt alone. The second word is generated by including the first word in the response, then the third word by including the first two generated words, and so on. This processâcalled autoregressionârepeats until the LLM has finished\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is possible to write down the rules for how they work, LLM sâ outputs are not entirely predictable; it turns out that these extremely big abacuses can do things which smaller ones cannot, in ways which surprise even the people who make them. Jason Wei, a researcher at Open AI , has counted 137 so-called âemergentâ abilities across a variety of different LLM s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abilities that emerge are not magicâthey are all represented in some form within the LLM sâ training data (or the prompts they are given) but they do not become apparent until the LLM s cross a certain, very large, threshold in their size. At one size, an LLM does not know how to write gender-inclusive sentences in German any better than if it was doing so at random. Make the model just a little bigger, however, and all of a sudden a new ability pops out. GPT -4 passed the American Uniform Bar Examination, designed to test the skills of lawyers before they become licensed, in the 90th percentile. The slightly smaller GPT -3.5 flunked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergent abilities are exciting, because they hint at the untapped potential of LLM s. Jonas Degrave, an engineer at DeepMind, an AI research company owned by Alphabet, has shown that Chat GPT can be convinced to act like the command line terminal of a computer, appearing to compile and run programs accurately. Just a little bigger, goes the thinking, and the models may suddenly be able to do all manner of useful new things. But experts worry for the same reason. One analysis shows that certain social biases emerge when models become large. It is not easy to tell what harmful behaviours might be lying dormant, waiting for just a little more scale in order to be unleashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Process the data\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent success of LLM s in generating convincing text, as well as their startling emergent abilities, is due to the coalescence of three things: gobsmacking quantities of data, algorithms capable of learning from them and the computational power to do so (see chart). The details of GPT -4âs construction and function are not yet public, but those of GPT -3 are, in a paper called âLanguage Models are Few-Shot Learnersâ, published in 2020 by Open AI .\n",

      "\n",
      "Before it sees any training data, the weights in GPT -3âs neural network are mostly random. As a result, any text it generates will be gibberish. Pushing its output towards something which makes sense, and eventually something that is fluent, requires training. GPT -3 was trained on several sources of data, but the bulk of it comes from snapshots of the entire internet between 2016 and 2019 taken from a database called Common Crawl. Thereâs a lot of junk text on the internet, so the initial 45 terabytes were filtered using a different machine-learning model to select just the high-quality text: 570 gigabytes of it, a dataset that could fit on a modern laptop. In addition, GPT -4 was trained on an unknown quantity of images, probably several terabytes. By comparison AlexNet, a neural network that reignited image-processing excitement in the 2010s, was trained on a dataset of 1.2m labelled images, a total of 126 gigabytesâless than a tenth of the size of GPT -4âs likely dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "To train, the LLM quizzes itself on the text it is given. It takes a chunk, covers up some words at the end, and tries to guess what might go there. Then the LLM uncovers the answer and compares it to its guess. Because the answers are in the data itself, these models can be trained in a âself-supervisedâ manner on massive datasets without requiring human labellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The modelâs goal is to make its guesses as good as possible by making as few errors as possible. Not all errors are equal, though. If the original text is âI love ice creamâ, guessing âI love ice hockeyâ is better than âI love ice areâ. How bad a guess is is turned into a number called the loss. After a few guesses, the loss is sent back into the neural network and used to nudge the weights in a direction that will produce better answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trailblazing a daze\n",
      "\n",
      "The LLM âs attention network is key to learning from such vast amounts of data. It builds into the model a way to learn and use associations between words and concepts even when they appear at a distance from each other within a text, and it allows it to process reams of data in a reasonable amount of time. Many different attention networks operate in parallel within a typical LLM and this parallelisation allows the process to be run across multiple GPU s. Older, non-attention-based versions of language models would not have been able to process such a quantity of data in a reasonable amount of time. âWithout attention, the scaling would not be computationally tractable,â says Yoshua Bengio, scientific director of Mila, a prominent AI research institute in Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sheer scale at which LLM s can process data has been driving their recent growth. GPT -3 has hundreds of layers, billions of weights, and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. By contrast, the first version of GPT , created five years ago, was just one ten-thousandth of the size.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are good reasons, says Dr Bengio, to think that this growth cannot continue indefinitely. The inputs of LLM sâdata, computing power, electricity, skilled labourâcost money. Training GPT -3, for example, used 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity (enough to power 121 homes in America for a year), and cost Open AI an estimated $4.6m. GPT -4, which is a much larger model, will have cost disproportionately more (in the realm of $100m) to train. Since computing-power requirements scale up dramatically faster than the input data, training LLM s gets expensive faster than it gets better. Indeed, Sam Altman, the boss of Open AI , seems to think an inflection point has already arrived. On April 13th he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: âI think weâre at the end of the era where itâs going to be these, like, giant, giant models. Weâll make them better in other ways.â\n",
      "\n",
      "But the most important limit to the continued improvement of LLM s is the amount of training data available. GPT -3 has already been trained on what amounts to all of the high-quality text that is available to download from the internet. A paper published in October 2022 concluded that âthe stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon; likely before 2026.â There is certainly more text available, but it is locked away in small amounts in corporate databases or on personal devices, inaccessible at the scale and low cost that Common Crawl allows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computers will get more powerful over time, but there is no new hardware forthcoming which offers a leap in performance as large as that which came from using GPU s in the early 2010s, so training larger models will probably be increasingly expensiveâperhaps why Mr Altman is not enthused by the idea. Improvements are possible, including new kinds of chips such as Googleâs Tensor Processing Unit, but the manufacturing of chips is no longer improving exponentially through Mooreâs law and shrinking circuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "There will also be legal issues. Stability AI , a company which produces an image-generation model called Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images, a photography agency. Stable Diffusionâs training data comes from the same place as GPT -3 and GPT -4, Common Crawl, and it processes it in very similar ways, using attention networks. Some of the most striking examples of AI âs generative prowess have been images. People on the internet are now regularly getting caught up in excitement about apparent photos of scenes that never took place: the pope in a Balenciaga jacket; Donald Trump being arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty points to images produced by Stable Diffusion which contain its copyright watermark, suggesting that Stable Diffusion has ingested and is reproducing copyrighted material without permission (Stability AI has not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit). The same level of evidence is harder to come by when examining Chat GPT âs text output, but there is no doubt that it has been trained on copyrighted material. Open AI will be hoping that its text generation is covered by âfair useâ, a provision in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material for âtransformativeâ purposes. That idea will probably one day be tested in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major appliance\n",
      "\n",
      "But even in a scenario where LLM s stopped improving this year, and a blockbuster lawsuit drove Open AI to bankruptcy, the power of large language models would remain. The data and the tools to process it are widely available, even if the sheer scale achieved by Open AI remains expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open-source implementations, when trained carefully and selectively, are already aping the performance of GPT -4. This is a good thing: having the power of LLM s in many hands means that many minds can come up with innovative new applications, improving everything from medicine to the law.\n"

      "Science & technology | Generative AI Large, creative AI models will transform lives and labour markets They bring enormous promise and peril. In the first of three special articles we explain how they work\\n\\nImage: George Wylesol\\n\\nS ince November 2022, when Open AI , the company which makes Chat GPT , first opened the chatbot to the public, there has been little else that the tech elite has wanted to talk about. As this article was being written, the founder of a London technology company messaged your correspondent unprompted to say that this kind of AI is âessentially all Iâm thinking about these daysâ. He says he is in the process of redesigning his company, valued at many hundreds of millions of dollars, around it. He is not alone.\\n\\nGPT embodies TSMC , a Taiwanese semiconductor firm that finds itself in the geopolitical crosshairs.

GPT -4 is a type of generative AI called a large language model ( LLM ).

Running alongside this excitement is deep concern , inside the tech industry and beyond, that generativemodels are being developed too quickly.-4 is a type of generativecalled a large language model (). Tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia have all trained their owns, and given them names like, Megatron, Titan and Chinchilla.\\n\\nThe lure grows greater\\n\\nThe London tech boss says he is âincredibly nervous about the existential threatâ posed by AI , even as he pursues it, and is âspeaking with [other] founders about it dailyâ. Governments in America, Europe and China have all started mulling new regulations. Prominent voices are calling for the development of artificial intelligence to be paused, lest the software somehow run out of control and damage, or even destroy, human society. To calibrate how worried or excited you should be about this technology, it helps first to understand where it came from, how it works and what the limits are to its growth.\\n\\nThe contemporary explosion of the capabilities of AI software began in the early 2010s, when a software technique called âdeep learningâ became popular. Using the magic mix of vast datasets and powerful computers running neural networks on Graphics Processing Units ( GPU s), deep learning dramatically improved computersâ abilities to recognise images, process audio and play games. By the late 2010s computers could do many of these tasks better than any human.\\n\\nBut neural networks tended to be embedded in software with broader functionality, like email clients, and non-coders rarely interacted with these AI s directly. Those that did often described their experience in near-spiritual terms. Lee Sedol, one of the worldâs best players of Go, an ancient Chinese board game, retired from the game after Alphabetâs neural-net-based AlphaGo software crushed him in 2016. âEven if I become the number one,â he said, âthere is an entity that cannot be defeated.â\\n\\nBy working in the most human of mediums, conversation, Chat GPT is now allowing the internet-using public to experience something similar, a kind of intellectual vertigo caused by software which has improved suddenly to the point where it can perform tasks that had been exclusively in the domain of human intelligence.\\n\\nDespite that feeling of magic, an LLM is, in reality, a giant exercise in statistics. Prompt Chat GPT to finish the sentence: âThe promise of large language models is that theyâ¦â and you will get an immediate response. How does it work?\\n\\nFirst, the language of the query is converted from words, which neural networks cannot handle, into a representative set of numbers (see graphic). GPT -3, which powered an earlier version of Chat GPT , does this by splitting text into chunks of characters, called tokens, which commonly occur together. These tokens can be words, like âloveâ or âareâ, affixes, like âdisâ or âisedâ, and punctuation, like â?â. GPT -3âs dictionary contains details of 50,257 tokens.\\n\\nTokenisation Theââ 464 ââpromiseââ 6991 ââofââ 286 ââlargeââ 1588 ââlanguageââ 3303 ââmodelsââ 4981 ââisââ 318 ââthatââ 326 ââtheyââ 484\\n\\nGPT -3 is able to process a maximum of 2,048 tokens at a time, which is around the length of a long article in The Economist. GPT -4, by contrast, can handle inputs up to 32,000 tokens longâa novella. The more text the model can take in, the more context it can see, and the better its answers will be. There is a catchâthe required computation rises non-linearly with the length of the input, meaning slightly longer inputs need much more computing power.\\n\\nThe tokens are then assigned the equivalent of definitions by placing them into a âmeaning spaceâ where words that have similar meanings are located in nearby areas.\\n\\nEmbedding facsimile vocabulary language tongue model replica aptitude talent speech duplicate imitation potentiality ability representation potential capability massive lookalike promise capacity great vast huge enourmous big large facsimile vocabulary language tongue model replica aptitude talent speech duplicate imitation potentiality ability representation potential capability massive lookalike promise capacity great vast huge enourmous big large vocabulary language tongue aptitude talent speech potentiality ability potential capability promise capacity facsimile model replica duplicate imitation massive representation great vast huge lookalike enourmous big large\\n\\nThe LLM then deploys its âattention networkâ to make connections between different parts of the prompt. Someone reading our prompt, âthe promise of large language models is that theyâ¦â, would know how English grammar works and understand the concepts behind the words in the sentence. It would be obvious to them which words relate to each otherâit is the model that is large, for example. An LLM , however, must learn these associations from scratch during its training phaseâover billions of training runs, its attention network slowly encodes the structure of the language it sees as numbers (called âweightsâ) within its neural network. If it understands language at all, an LLM only does so in a statistical, rather than a grammatical, way. It is much more like an abacus than it is like a mind.\\n\\nOnce the prompt has been processed, the LLM initiates a response. At this point, for each of the tokens in the modelâs vocabulary, the attention network has produced a probability of that token being the most appropriate one to use next in the sentence it is generating. The token with the highest probability score is not always the one chosen for the responseâhow the LLM makes this choice depends on how creative the model has been told to be by its operators.\\n\\nThe LLM generates a word and then feeds the result back into itself. The first word is generated based on the prompt alone. The second word is generated by including the first word in the response, then the third word by including the first two generated words, and so on. This processâcalled autoregressionârepeats until the LLM has finished\\n\\nAlthough it is possible to write down the rules for how they work, LLM sâ outputs are not entirely predictable; it turns out that these extremely big abacuses can do things which smaller ones cannot, in ways which surprise even the people who make them. Jason Wei, a researcher at Open AI , has counted 137 so-called âemergentâ abilities across a variety of different LLM s.\\n\\nThe abilities that emerge are not magicâthey are all represented in some form within the LLM sâ training data (or the prompts they are given) but they do not become apparent until the LLM s cross a certain, very large, threshold in their size. At one size, an LLM does not know how to write gender-inclusive sentences in German any better than if it was doing so at random. Make the model just a little bigger, however, and all of a sudden a new ability pops out. GPT -4 passed the American Uniform Bar Examination, designed to test the skills of lawyers before they become licensed, in the 90th percentile. The slightly smaller GPT -3.5 flunked it.\\n\\nEmergent abilities are exciting, because they hint at the untapped potential of LLM s. Jonas Degrave, an engineer at DeepMind, an AI research company owned by Alphabet, has shown that Chat GPT can be convinced to act like the command line terminal of a computer, appearing to compile and run programs accurately. Just a little bigger, goes the thinking, and the models may suddenly be able to do all manner of useful new things. But experts worry for the same reason. One analysis shows that certain social biases emerge when models become large. It is not easy to tell what harmful behaviours might be lying dormant, waiting for just a little more scale in order to be unleashed.\\n\\nProcess the data\\n\\nThe recent success of LLM s in generating convincing text, as well as their startling emergent abilities, is due to the coalescence of three things: gobsmacking quantities of data, algorithms capable of learning from them and the computational power to do so (see chart). The details of GPT -4âs construction and function are not yet public, but those of GPT -3 are, in a paper called âLanguage Models are Few-Shot Learnersâ, published in 2020 by Open AI .\\n\\nFaster, higher, more calculations Computing power used in training AI systems Selected systems, floating-point operations, log scale Academia Industry Research consortium GPT-4 GPT-3 Stable Diffusion Transformer Theseus 1950 60 70 80 90 2000 10 23 Sources: Sevilla et al., 2023; Our World in Data\\n\\nBefore it sees any training data, the weights in GPT -3âs neural network are mostly random. As a result, any text it generates will be gibberish. Pushing its output towards something which makes sense, and eventually something that is fluent, requires training. GPT -3 was trained on several sources of data, but the bulk of it comes from snapshots of the entire internet between 2016 and 2019 taken from a database called Common Crawl. Thereâs a lot of junk text on the internet, so the initial 45 terabytes were filtered using a different machine-learning model to select just the high-quality text: 570 gigabytes of it, a dataset that could fit on a modern laptop. In addition, GPT -4 was trained on an unknown quantity of images, probably several terabytes. By comparison AlexNet, a neural network that reignited image-processing excitement in the 2010s, was trained on a dataset of 1.2m labelled images, a total of 126 gigabytesâless than a tenth of the size of GPT -4âs likely dataset.\\n\\nTo train, the LLM quizzes itself on the text it is given. It takes a chunk, covers up some words at the end, and tries to guess what might go there. Then the LLM uncovers the answer and compares it to its guess. Because the answers are in the data itself, these models can be trained in a âself-supervisedâ manner on massive datasets without requiring human labellers.\\n\\nThe modelâs goal is to make its guesses as good as possible by making as few errors as possible. Not all errors are equal, though. If the original text is âI love ice creamâ, guessing âI love ice hockeyâ is better than âI love ice areâ. How bad a guess is is turned into a number called the loss. After a few guesses, the loss is sent back into the neural network and used to nudge the weights in a direction that will produce better answers.\\n\\nTrailblazing a daze\\n\\nThe LLM âs attention network is key to learning from such vast amounts of data. It builds into the model a way to learn and use associations between words and concepts even when they appear at a distance from each other within a text, and it allows it to process reams of data in a reasonable amount of time. Many different attention networks operate in parallel within a typical LLM and this parallelisation allows the process to be run across multiple GPU s. Older, non-attention-based versions of language models would not have been able to process such a quantity of data in a reasonable amount of time. âWithout attention, the scaling would not be computationally tractable,â says Yoshua Bengio, scientific director of Mila, a prominent AI research institute in Quebec.\\n\\nThe sheer scale at which LLM s can process data has been driving their recent growth. GPT -3 has hundreds of layers, billions of weights, and was trained on hundreds of billions of words. By contrast, the first version of GPT , created five years ago, was just one ten-thousandth of the size.\\n\\nBut there are good reasons, says Dr Bengio, to think that this growth cannot continue indefinitely. The inputs of LLM sâdata, computing power, electricity, skilled labourâcost money. Training GPT -3, for example, used 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity (enough to power 121 homes in America for a year), and cost Open AI an estimated $4.6m. GPT -4, which is a much larger model, will have cost disproportionately more (in the realm of $100m) to train. Since computing-power requirements scale up dramatically faster than the input data, training LLM s gets expensive faster than it gets better. Indeed, Sam Altman, the boss of Open AI , seems to think an inflection point has already arrived. On April 13th he told an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: âI think weâre at the end of the era where itâs going to be these, like, giant, giant models. Weâll make them better in other ways.â\\n\\nBut the most important limit to the continued improvement of LLM s is the amount of training data available. GPT -3 has already been trained on what amounts to all of the high-quality text that is available to download from the internet. A paper published in October 2022 concluded that âthe stock of high-quality language data will be exhausted soon; likely before 2026.â There is certainly more text available, but it is locked away in small amounts in corporate databases or on personal devices, inaccessible at the scale and low cost that Common Crawl allows.\\n\\nComputers will get more powerful over time, but there is no new hardware forthcoming which offers a leap in performance as large as that which came from using GPU s in the early 2010s, so training larger models will probably be increasingly expensiveâperhaps why Mr Altman is not enthused by the idea. Improvements are possible, including new kinds of chips such as Googleâs Tensor Processing Unit, but the manufacturing of chips is no longer improving exponentially through Mooreâs law and shrinking circuits.\\n\\nThere will also be legal issues. Stability AI , a company which produces an image-generation model called Stable Diffusion, has been sued by Getty Images, a photography agency. Stable Diffusionâs training data comes from the same place as GPT -3 and GPT -4, Common Crawl, and it processes it in very similar ways, using attention networks. Some of the most striking examples of AI âs generative prowess have been images. People on the internet are now regularly getting caught up in excitement about apparent photos of scenes that never took place: the pope in a Balenciaga jacket; Donald Trump being arrested.\\n\\nGetty points to images produced by Stable Diffusion which contain its copyright watermark, suggesting that Stable Diffusion has ingested and is reproducing copyrighted material without permission (Stability AI has not yet commented publicly on the lawsuit). The same level of evidence is harder to come by when examining Chat GPT âs text output, but there is no doubt that it has been trained on copyrighted material. Open AI will be hoping that its text generation is covered by âfair useâ, a provision in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material for âtransformativeâ purposes. That idea will probably one day be tested in court.\\n\\nA major appliance\\n\\nBut even in a scenario where LLM s stopped improving this year, and a blockbuster lawsuit drove Open AI to bankruptcy, the power of large language models would remain. The data and the tools to process it are widely available, even if the sheer scale achieved by Open AI remains expensive.\\n\\nOpen-source implementations, when trained carefully and selectively, are already aping the performance of GPT -4. This is a good thing: having the power of LLM s in many hands means that many minds can come up with innovative new applications, improving everything from medicine to the law.\n",

its exceptional capabilities and even helping millions around the globe academically. Now, in the latest viral claim, the artificial intelligence (AI) tool helped a student prepare for his exam and score a stunning 94 per cent. Taking to Reddit, a student revealed he felt anxious about his upcoming semester examinations when he sought help from ChatGPT.\\n\\n\"Hello, This is just my review and innovation on utilising AI to assist with education,\" the Reddit user wrote in his post. In the next few lines, he explained how he used the AI chatbot to study for his exams. \"I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture,\" he claimed.\\n\\nIn the Reddit post, the user explained that he fed as much information as possible into ChatGPT and asked the chatbot to analyse them.\\n\\n\"I spent the first day Listing the purpose of each discussion and the major points of every lecturer in the manner of 4-5 hours despite all of the content adding up to 24-30 hours. The next day, I asked Chat gpt to define every term listed as the significant \"point\" in every lecture only using the course textbook and the transcript that had been summarized; this took me 4-5 hours to make sure the information was accurate,\" the user wrote.\\n\\nThe student also mentioned how a day before his exam, he referred to the study material provided by ChatGPT and that his exam included questions from the content that he was taught by the AI tool. \"The result: I got a 94 on the exam, despite me studying only for three days without watching a single lecture,\" he claimed.\\n\\nAt the end of his post, the student also pointed out \"This was not a hard course, but it was very extensive, lots of reading and understanding that needed to be applied. Chat gpt excelled in this because the course text was already heavily analysed, and it specialises in understanding text.\"\\n\\nAlso Read | Stress Increases Our Biological Age But It Can Be Restored: Study\\n\\nThe Reddit post was shared a few days ago and since then it has accumulated more than 8,700 Upvotes. \"Yeah, AI really cuts down on the time it takes to sift out the useful information,\" wrote one user in the comment section.\\n\\n\"I just used it last night to help me study for my statistics exam. When I try to search for ways to solve the problems online, solutions are either WAY too in-depth and unnecessary or fail to explain the problem on the test. What's the solution? I ask chat-gpt to teach me how to solve the problem, and it breaks everything down step by step and explains why things are done that way,\" added another.\n",

has reenergized the global tech sector. As investors pour billions into AI startups, will tough regulations stop humans from losing control?\\n\\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) gold rush is truly underway. After the release last November of ChatGPT — a game-changing content-generating platform — by research and development company OpenAI, several other tech giants, including Google and Alibaba have raced to release their own versions.\\n\\nInvestors from Shanghai to Silicon Valley are now pouring tens of billions of dollars into startups specializing in so-called generative AI in what some analysts think could become a new dot-com bubble.\\n\\nThe speed at which algorithms rather than humans have been utilized to create high-quality text, software code, music, video and images has sparked concerns that millions of jobs globally could be replaced and the technology may even start controlling humans.\\n\\nBut even Tesla boss Elon Musk, who has repeatedly warned of the dangers of AI, has announced plans to launch a rival to ChatGPT.\\n\\nElon Musk told FOX News that his AI version called TruthGPT would be less of a threat than the others Image: FOX News via AP/picture alliance\\n\\nChatGPT quickly adopted\\n\\nBusinesses and organizations have quickly discovered ways to easily integrate generative AI into functions like customer services, marketing, and software development. Analysts say the enthusiasm of early adopters will likely have a massive snowball effect.\\n\\n\"The next two to three years will define so much about generative AI,\" David Foster, cofounder of Applied Data Science Partners, a London-based AI and data consultancy, told DW. \"We will talk about it in the same way as the internet itself — how it changes everything that we do as a human species.\"\\n\\nFoster noted how generative AI is being integrated into tools companies already have, like Microsoft Office, so they don't need to make huge upfront investments to get a significant benefit from the technology.\\n\\nChatGPT and the others are still far from perfect, however. They mostly assist in the creative process with prompts from humans but are not yet worker substitutes. But last month, an even more intelligent upgrade, ChatGPT-4 was rushed out, and version 5 is rumored for release by the end of the year.\\n\\nAnother advancement, AutoGPT, was launched at the end of last month, which can further automate tasks that ChatGPT needs human input for.\\n\\nMyriads of uses are emerging from ChatGPT — like for example a robot powered with the AI in a school in Cyprus Image: Yiannis Kourtoglou/REUTERS\\n\\nBillions pour into AI projects\\n\\nResearch last month by Deutsche Bank showed that total global corporate investment into AI has grown 150% since 2019 to nearly $180 billion (€164 billion), and nearly 30-fold since 2013. The number of public AI projects rose to nearly 350,000 by end of last year, with more than 140,000 patents filed for AI technology alone in 2021.\\n\\nStartups don't need to reinvent what's already been created. Instead, they can focus on adapting the current generative AI platforms for specialist uses, including cures for cancers, smart finance and gaming.\\n\\n\"You have a new market emerging, a bit like when the [smartphone] app stores opened up. Small startups will make creative use of the technology, even though they didn't create it themselves,\" author and AI researcher Thomas Ramge told DW.\\n\\nWhile the US has until now led the world in AI development, China has recently closed the gap along with India. China is now responsible for 18% of all high-impact AI projects, compared to 14% for the US, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nThe dark side of the shiny AI tool ChatGPT To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\\n\\nChina steps up as AI competitor\\n\\nThe East-West race for economic dominance, however, is overshadowed by the threat of how an authoritarian government, like Beijing, could further use AI to control not only its population but the rest of the world. Some think this fear is overblown, however, as China's leaders have their own anxieties over the power of algorithms.\\n\\n\"The Chinese government has been regulating AI because they see very clearly that it could cause them to lose control,\" AI expert and MIT professor Max Tegmark told DW. \"So they're limiting the freedom of companies to just experiment wildly with poorly understood stuff.\"\\n\\nTegmark is more concerned about the race by Western tech giants to push the technology toward the outer edges of acceptability and beyond. He noted that the US is hesitant to introduce AI regulations, due to lobbying by the tech sector. Repeated warnings about the need to avoid a so-called AI arms race have fallen on deaf ears.\\n\\n\"Sadly, that's exactly what we have right now,\" said Tegmark, \"They [corporate leaders] understand the risks, they want to do the right thing, but they can't stop. No company can pause alone because they're just going to have their lunch eaten by the competition and get killed by their shareholders.\"\\n\\nTwo years of work by the European Union on the Artificial Intelligence Act, which was due to be enacted this year, was upended by the launch of ChatGPT, which sent policymakers back to the drawing board.\\n\\n4 ways AI will reshape society To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\\n\\nEurope, meanwhile, is struggling to match the hunger of its US and Asian tech counterparts in the generative AI space due to investors being risk-averse.\\n\\n\"Same old story. Europe is lagging behind,\" Ramge said. \"It did not foresee this trend and is once again claiming it will be able to catch up.\"\\n\\nRamge highlighted two potential stars — a German plan to create a European AI infrastructure known as LEAM, and the Heidelberg-based startup Aleph Alpha, despite the latter raising just $31.1 million to date, versus OpenAI's $11 billion.\\n\\n\"What Europe is not able to do is to transfer the knowledge out of the universities into rapidly growing startups — unicorns — that in the end are able to bring the new technology to the world,\" he told DW.\\n\\nEdited by: Uwe Hessler\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ChatGPT has kicked off an AI revolution. Companies from Google to Microsoft, Amazon and Meta had all been working on AI projects for years, but the floodgates opened when OpenAI dropped ChatGPT as a free preview for anyone to use in late 2022.\\n\\nSince then, we’ve seen many competitors and copycats come out to try and capture a piece of the AI market. Some are more focused on tasks and coding while some are purely conversational. Some are open source, some are actually multiple chatbots in one location and there are many more. If you prefer not to use ChatGPT — or specifically the free version that OpenAI has available for everyone — there are a fair amount of options.\\n\\nSo we decide to put together a list of our favorite ChatGPT alternatives that we’ve tested so far. Some of these run on the same large language model (LLM) as ChatGPT, but we felt they were different enough to merit inclusion.\\n\\nMicrosoft Bing with ChatGPT\\n\\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\\n\\nIf ChatGPT lit the AI fire, Microsoft poured gasoline on it with its Bing chatbot. Bing Chat — or Bing with ChatGPT — takes the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) LLM behind ChatGPT and puts it in Microsoft’s search engine. Since its introduction, Bing has taken off and now has over 100 million active users daily.\\n\\nBing Chat operates fairly similarly to ChatGPT. You enter in a prompt, and the chatbot responds accordingly. However, there are a few notable differences. First, the Bing chatbot is plugged into the Bing search engine, so it crawls through the internet to find the information it needs to respond to your prompts. It also will provide you with follow-up prompts, cites its sources by default (mostly) and can be changed in tone to be more creative, more precise or to be balanced between the two.\\n\\nIf you want to try a chatbot for the first time, this may even be a better option than ChatGPT. And if you like it, there are a ton of integrations from your phone’s keyboard to the Windows 11 taskbar . So check out our guide to using Bing with ChatGPT and make sure to get on the Bing with ChatGPT waitlist .\\n\\nGoogle Bard\\n\\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\\n\\nGoogle Bard is Google’s response to ChatGPT, which appears to have caught the search giant totally off guard. Bard uses a combination of two LLMs — Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) and Pathways Language Model (PaLM). PaLM in particular gives Bard a boost , bringing improved math and logic capabilities to the AI chatbot.\\n\\nThis chatbot is similar to Bing with ChatGPT and the ChatGPT you can access on Open AI’s site, but its features are a bit more limited. However, Google is regularly updating Bard's features through \"Experiment updates\" and has even upgraded Bard so that the AI chatbot can now write code. It is also decent as a research tool that you can hold a conversation with, even if it sometimes gets things wrong . We’re hopeful that its feature set will continue to expand as time goes on.\\n\\nWe even compared Bing with ChatGPT versus Google Bard and the results were surprisingly close. While Bing’s chatbot was better at certain things and was more accurate, Bard held its own. We also asked it to answer five controversial sci-fi questions and again, it did a surprisingly good job.\\n\\nSo if you want to try out Google Bard, make sure you get on the Bard waitlist . And use our guide on how to use Google Bard to get the most out of the chatbot.\\n\\nYouChat\\n\\n(Image credit: You.com)\\n\\nYou.com is a search engine that has actually had an AI chatbot longer than Microsoft’s Bing. Created by former Salesforce employees, the search engine introduced YouChat in December 2022 — upgrading to YouChat 2.0 in February 2023.\\n\\nThe big selling point of YouChat and its LLM called Conversation, Apps and Links (C-A-L) is that it can integrate You.com apps for sites such as Reddit and YouTube into its chatbot’s responses.\\n\\nYouChat showed some promise when we tested it, but the app integration is not fully there yet.\\n\\nThis is akin to what is called “multimodal” chat, which is when a chatbot either accepts inputs in more than just text, produces outputs in more than just text, or some combination of the two. For reference, ChatGPT is not a multimodal chatbot in the free research preview that most people can access, though its new GPT-4 LLM is a multimodal chat model because it can handle image inputs.\\n\\nYouChat showed some promise when we tested it, but the app integration is not fully there yet. At this point, we would still recommend using Bing with ChatGPT, as it can provide additional context like YouChat as well as produce images through Bing Image Generator . Still, if you’re looking for an alternative to Bing or Bard, YouChat is a third option worth exploring.\\n\\nAuto-GPT\\n\\n(Image credit: AgentGPT)\\n\\nAuto-GPT is a really cool ChatGPT variant, but it takes a bit of coding skill to work. At first glance, it is very similar to ChatGPT, and in fact, it runs on OpenAI’s GPT-4 LLM. But Auto-GPT is semi-autonomous, which is a game-changing feature.\\n\\nWith traditional ChatGPT, you have to do the work of prompting the AI. Say you are trying to build a business plan for a restaurant — you ask ChatGPT the prompt, it gives you a response and then you ask follow-up prompts to fine-tune the plan. But with Auto-GPT, you just set the chatbot a goal of developing the business plan, and then the chatbot will handle setting all the tasks, asking and answering follow-up prompts, etc. It eliminates a significant amount of the work you need to do.\\n\\nThe catch? You need to know how to code with Python. Auto-GPT relies on a Python environment to run. You also need to set up a ChatGPT API account with OpenAI to connect the GPT-4 LLM to the Python environment. So it’s not a simple chatbot to use, unlike the previous three we’ve discussed.\\n\\nHowever, there is a way to try out Auto-GPT if you’re not a coding expert. AgentGPT (opens in new tab) is a free beta that already has the Python environment set up and is connected to the GPT-4 LLM. You can’t do a ton with it — the beta version limits you too how much time you can spend with Auto-GPT — but it still is a great way to try out Auto-GPT. And if you have a ChatGPT API key, you can connect it to AgentGPT and have it use your API key instead of the beta’s API key. We haven’t tried that feature yet though, so proceed at your own risk.\\n\\nStableLM\\n\\n(Image credit: Hugging Face)\\n\\nStablity AI is another player in the AI space that competes with Open AI. Its biggest success is the Stable Diffusion AI image generator , but it has now launched an open source LLM called StableLM . You can try it out over at Hugging Face (opens in new tab), an AI community site that has a free Alpha test of StableLM running that anyone can try.\\n\\nThere are some downsides to StableLM versus ChatGPT. StableLM is not trained on the same quantity of information as ChatGPT — it is trained on just 3 billion to 7 billion parameters compared to OpenAI’s 175 billion-parameter GPT-4 model. And it lacks the reinforcement training that consistently improves ChatGPT (this is done through users saying that they did or did not get the desired response from the chatbot).\\n\\nStill, StableLM does work. we had it generate a business plan for a pizza restaurant and with some follow-up prompts, we was able to generate an executive summary, strategic goals and revenue projections. It wasn’t perfect and it was noticeably slower than ChatGPT, but it was impressive nonetheless.\\n\\nMost likely, StableLM will be a ChatGPT alternative to watch for the future, but it is still worth trying now.\\n\\nCatGPT\\n\\n(Image credit: CatGPT)\\n\\nNo, that’s not a typo. CatGPT is a real chatbot (catbot?) that you can use. This chatbot AI, like some of the other ChatGPT alternatives we’ve mentioned, is based on the GPT model that ChatGPT uses, but we promise you, it’s not the same experience.\\n\\nThat’s because, with CatGPT, every response is as if you were chatting with a cat. It’s completely free to use — though it features an easy way to donate to the Humane Society (opens in new tab) if you so desire.\\n\\nIs it a great research tool? Or a great choice if you want to code a website or build a business plan? No. But, it’s hilarious, and sometimes that’s all you need. Trust us, CatGPT is the purrfect ChatGPT alternative.\\n\\nPoe\\n\\n(Image credit: Poe)\\n\\nPoe (opens in new tab) isn’t one alternative to ChatGPT — it’s several. The app was designed by Quora, the popular question-and-answer website, and it combines seven AI chatbots into one user interface. Let’s go through them one by one.\\n\\nFirst, is Sage. Sage is a chatbot that runs on OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 turbo LLM and is particularly good for using languages other than English and programming tasks.\\n\\nGPT-4 should be trained on newer information from what we know, but since Poe is warning you, we suggest treading with caution regardless.\\n\\nThen there’s Claude Plus and Claude-instant, both of which are developed by Anthropic , an AI company that is partially backed by Google. Claude-instant is a good tool for creative writing prompts and getting more in-depth answers. Claude Plus is similar but with better support for languages other than English. It only has limited access in Poe.\\n\\nThere is also Dragonfly, a bot powered by OpenAI’s davinci model, which was part of the GPT-3 LLM. It excels at short responses and does best the more context you can give it in prompts. And then there’s NeevaAI, which finds its information through the internet and is best as a Bing with ChatGPT alternative.\\n\\nFinally, you also get access to ChatGPT and GPT-4, though access to GPT-4 is limited. Poe says that all the chatbots outside of NeevaAI have not been trained with information more recent than 2021, so the one thing to keep in mind is that responses could be outdated. GPT-4 should be trained on newer information from what we know, but since Poe is warning you, we suggest treading with caution regardless.\\n\\nOutlook: Experiment away\\n\\n(Image credit: OpenAI)\\n\\nSo if you want to try a bunch of ChatGPT alternatives at once, Poe is a great solution. There’s even an iOS app for your iPhone. The biggest downside is that the responses can be limited, which can be frustrating. But hopefully, between it and the six other options we’ve presented, you have plenty of ChatGPT alternatives to try out.\n",



                                                 Today, it seems like AI chatbots are everywhere, from search engines to online stores. Someday soon, we can expect most games to use LLMs (Large Language Models) such as GPT-4 to make their NPCs more lifelike. And, if you play Minecraft Java edition, you can incorporate AI chat right now via your choice of mods.\\n\\nOur favorite Minecraft AI mod right now is AIMobs (opens in new tab), which allows you to have conversations with individual mobs (Minecraft's term for NPCs). You can converse with an Enderman, a Creeper, a Sheep, a Villager, a Cow, or any living (or undead thing) and it will tell you specific things about itself. For example, an Iron Golem told me that it's not actually a robot, but a magic creature. You can also ask more generic, Minecraft or non-Minecraft questions and the mobs will give you an answer.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that you only get to chat. You can ask a mob to help you with a task, but it will only give you advice. For example, when I asked an Axolotl for some Netherite, it told me that I could find some in the Nether. If you don't want to chat with mobs but do what ChatGPT available from the Minecraft chat function, another mod called MCChatGPT (opens in new tab) provides that service.\\n\\nBelow, we'll show you how to install and use both AIMobs and MCChatGPT to get AI / ChatGPT functionality in Minecraft Java Edition. To use either of these, you'll need the following:\\n\\nMinecraft AI / ChatGPT: What You Need\\n\\nAn OpenAI API Key: You can sign up for a free account on OpenAI and register for an API key (opens in new tab) on its site. Note that you have to pay for use of the API key, though you may get a small amount of free credit when you sign up. Depending on how much you chat, the cost may be quite small. During all of our Minecraft chats writing this tutorial, we used up $0.70 worth of API credits.\\n\\nYou can sign up for a free account on OpenAI and register for an API key on its site.

Minecraft Java Edition : This will only work with Java Edition, not with Bedrock.\\n\\n: This will only work with Java Edition, not with Bedrock. The AT Launcher: You can get the AT launcher here (opens in new tab) .\\n\\nHow to Use AIMobs to Get ChatGPT in Minecraft\\n\\nAIMobs operates on the principle that you can have a conversation with any individual mob in Minecraft and that it will give you some answers that are customized for its mob type. For example, when we asked an Axolotl if it would like to return to the ocean, it said \"that would be very nice. I would love to see the ocean again.\" And when we talked to a Zombie it said \"I need you to find me some brains, so I can satisfy my hunger.\"\\n\\nHowever, none of the mobs can do anything more than talk and they seem blissfully unaware of what's actually happening to you or to them. For example, when we punched mobs while talking to them, they didn't say anything about it. Also, conversations continued even with mobs that had died or mobs that were miles away on the other side of our world.\\n\\nYou can talk to any mob by shift-clicking on it and starting the conversation in the chat (always available by hitting \"t\"). The conversation isn't over until you type \"goodbye,\" even if you walk away or kill the mob. Here's how to setup AIMobs.\\n\\n1. Open ATLauncher. if you don't have it installed, you can download it (opens in new tab).\\n\\n2. Click Vanilla Packs in the right column.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n3. Select Minecraft 1.19.3 and Fabric (under loader) then click Create Instance. You may also want to change the name of the instance to something memorable for you. Version 1.19.4 (the latest version) doesn’t work with the AIMobs mod yet.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nYou’ll get a message when the instance has been created and you can click OK to dismiss.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n4. Click Instances in the right column.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n5. Click Add Mods under your instance.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n6. Select Modrinth from the leftmost dropdown menu. This is the website where it will look for the AIMobs mod.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n7. Enter “aimobs” into the search box, hit Enter and then click “Install Fabric API\" if prompted.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n8. Click Add in the dialog box that appears (if you needed to install Fabric mod).\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n9. Click Add under AIMobs.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n10. Click Add in the dialog box.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nYou’ll soon get a notification saying that AIMobs has installed. If you can't close the dialog box (which happened to us every time), right click on the ATLauncher tray icon and select “Kill Open Dialogs.”\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n11. Click Accounts and Login with Microsoft if you are not already logged in. Finish your log in.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n12. Click Play under your instance on the Instances tab.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n13. Click Singleplayer to start the game. Multiplayer games require this to be installed on the server.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n14. Click Create New World after choosing the settings for your world (or leaving the defaults).\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n15. Enter /aimobs setkey [APIKEY] in chat where [APIKEY] is your OpenAI API key. To get to Minecraft chat, hit “t.”\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n16. Enter /aimobs enable in chat.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n17. Shift + Left click on a mob to begin a conversation with it. You can then type any questions or responses into chat.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n18. Enter \"goodbye\" when you want to terminate a conversation with a mob.\\n\\nYou can use the following commands with the AIMobs mod.\\n\\n/aimobs - see configuration\\n\\n/aimobs help - see list of commands\\n\\n/aimobs enable - turn it on\\n\\n/aimobs disable - turn it off\\n\\n/aimobs setmodel [model] - Allows you to change the LLM. However, we were only able to get the default, text-davinci-003, to work.\\n\\n/aimbos settemp [temperature] - set the temperature (\"creativity\") of the AI\\n\\nHow to Enable Regular ChatGPT in Minecraft\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nIf you want regular ChatGPT in Minecraft, without the pretense that you’re talking to a mob, you can use a different mod called MCChatGPT. To set it up:\\n\\n1. Open ATLauncher, log into Minecraft and create an instance if you don't have one already.\\n\\n2. Click Add Mods under your instance on the Instances tab.\\n\\n3. Search for “chatgpt” and click Add. Make sure you are searching the Modrinth server. If you don't have Fabric API, you'll need to install it here.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n3. Click Add when prompted to install the Architectury API.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n4. Click Add in the dialog boxes for Architectury and MCChatGPT.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nYou’ll soon get a notification saying that MCChatGPT has installed. If you can’t close the dialog box, right click on the ATLauncher tray icon and select “Kill Open Dialogs.”\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\n5. Start a game of Minecraft by clicking Play on that instance, logging in if necessary and selecting a single player game. You should create a new world if one doesn't already exist in that instance.\\n\\n6. Enter /mcgpt-auth [APIKEY] into chat where [APIKEY] is your API key.\\n\\n(Image credit: Future)\\n\\nMCChatGPT is now set up and you can use the following chat commands with it:\\n\\n/ask [prompt] – ask a question\\n\\n/setcontextlevel [0-3] – You can provide a context level that gives the bot more information about the player and the world, allowing it to provide more specific answers to your questions. Level 0 provides no context information while three provides player, world and entity information, but at a cost of about 1,000 tokens (lots of $) per request.\\n\\n/nextconversation – begin new conversation\\n\\n/previousconversation – go back to the prior conversation\\n\\n/listconversations – get an index of all those you have had\\n\\n/setconversation [conversation id] – return to a prior conversation from the list\\n\\nMORE: How to Run a ChatGPT Alternative on Your Local\\n\\nMORE: How to Run ChatGPT on Raspberry Pi or PC\n",

                    What is Auto-GPT and why does it matter?\\n\\nSilicon Valley’s quest to automate everything is unceasing, which explains its latest obsession: Auto-GPT.\\n\\nIn essence, Auto-GPT uses the versatility of OpenAI’s latest AI models to interact with software and services online, allowing it to “autonomously” perform tasks like X and Y. But as we are learning with large language models, this capability seems to be as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle.\\n\\nAuto-GPT — which you might’ve seen blowing up on social media recently — is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI’s text-generating models, mainly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to act “autonomously.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s no magic in that autonomy. Auto-GPT simply handles follow-ups to an initial prompt of OpenAI’s models, both asking and answering them until a task is complete.\\n\\nAuto-GPT, basically, is GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 paired with a companion bot that instructs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 what to do. A user tells Auto-GPT what their goal is and the bot, in turn, uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and several programs to carry out every step needed to achieve whatever goal they’ve set.\\n\\nWhat makes Auto-GPT reasonably capable is its ability to interact with apps, software and services both online and local, like web browsers and word processors. For example, given a prompt like “help me grow my flower business,” Auto-GPT can develop a somewhat plausible advertising strategy and build a basic website.\\n\\n#AutoGPT is the new disruptive kid on the block- It can apply #ChatGPT's reasoning to broader, more intricate issues requiring planning & multiple steps. Still early but very impressive with many health and biomedicine applications. Just tried #AgentGPT and asked it to… pic.twitter.com/ywFhtjxjYD — Daniel Kraft, MD (@daniel_kraft) April 12, 2023\\n\\nAs Joe Koen, a software developer who’s experimented with Auto-GPT, explained to TechCrunch via email, Auto-GPT essentially automates multi-step projects that would’ve required back-and-forth prompting with a chatbot-oriented AI model like, say, OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\\n\\n“Auto-GPT defines an agent that communicates with OpenAI’s API,” Koen said. “This agent’s objective is to carry out a variety of commands that the AI generates in response to the agent’s requests. The user is prompted for input to specify the AI’s role and objectives prior to the agent starting to carry out commands.”\\n\\nIn a terminal, users describe the Auto-GPT agent’s name, role and objective and specify up to five ways to achieve that objective. For example:\\n\\nName: Smartphone-GPT\\n\\nSmartphone-GPT Role: An AI designed to find the best smartphone\\n\\nAn AI designed to find the best smartphone Objective: Find the best smartphones on the market\\n\\nFind the best smartphones on the market Goal 1: Do market research for different smartphones on the market today\\n\\nDo market research for different smartphones on the market today Goal 2: Get the top five smartphones and list their pros and cons\\n\\nBehind the scenes, Auto-GPT relies on features like memory management to execute tasks, along with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for text generation, file storage and summarization.\\n\\nAuto-GPT can also be hooked up to speech synthesizers, like ElevenLabs’, so that it can “place” phone calls, for example.\\n\\nAuto-GPT is publicly available on GitHub, but it does require some setup and know-how to get up and running. To use it, Auto-GPT has to be installed in a development environment like Docker, and it must be registered with an API key from OpenAI — which requires a paid OpenAI account.\\n\\nIt might be worth it — although the jury’s out on that. Early adopters have used Auto-GPT to take on the sorts of mundane tasks better delegated to a bot. For example, Auto-GPT can field items like debugging code and writing an email or more advanced things, like creating a business plan for a new startup.\\n\\n“If Auto-GPT encounters any obstacles or inability to finish the task, it’ll develop new prompts to help it navigate the situation and determine the appropriate next steps,” Adnan Masood, the chief architect at UST, a tech consultancy firm, told TechCrunch in an email. “Large language models excel at generating human-like responses, yet rely on user prompts and interactions to deliver desired outcomes. In contrast, Auto-GPT leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI’s API to operate independently without user intervention.”\\n\\nIn recent weeks, new apps have emerged to make Auto-GPT even easier to use, like AgentGPT and GodMode, which provide a simple interface where users can input what they want to accomplish directly on a browser page. Note that, like Agent-GPT, both require an API key from OpenAI to unlock their full capabilities.\\n\\nLike any powerful tool, however, Auto-GPT has its limitations — and risks.\\n\\nAutoGPT just exceeded PyTorch itself in GitHub stars (74k vs 65k). I see AutoGPT as a fun experiment, as the authors point out too. But nothing more. Prototypes are not meant to be production-ready. Don't let media fool you – most of the \"cool demos\" are heavily cherry-picked: 🧵 pic.twitter.com/I44H7BkCqr — Jim Fan (@DrJimFan) April 16, 2023\\n\\nDepending on what objective the tool’s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very… unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running — and then “killed” itself.\\n\\nThere’s also ChaosGPT, a modified version of Auto-GPT tasked with goals like “destroy humanity” and “establish global dominance.” Unsurprisingly, ChaosGPT hasn’t come close to bringing about the robot apocalypse — but it has tweeted rather unflatteringly about humankind.\\n\\nArguably more dangerous than Auto-GPT attempting to “destroy humanity” are the unanticipated problems that can crop up in otherwise perfectly normal scenarios, though. Because it’s built on OpenAI’s language models — models that, like all language models, are prone to inaccuracies — it can make errors.\\n\\nThat’s not the only problem. After successfully completing a task, Auto-GPT usually doesn’t recall how to perform it for later use, and — even when it does — it often won’t remember to use the program. Auto-GPT also struggles to effectively break complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and has trouble understanding how different goals overlap.\\n\\n“Auto-GPT illustrates the power and unknown risks of generative AI,” Clara Shih, the CEO of Salesforce’s Service Cloud and an Auto-GPT enthusiast, said via email. “For enterprises, it is especially important to include a human in the loop approach when developing and using generative AI technologies like Auto-GPT.”\n",

                                                         Artificial intelligence is making some major leaps in recent times. With tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, millions of people around the world are finding newer ways to enhance their productivity and amplify creativity. Now, everyone has access to an AI-powered virtual assistant that writes essays, simplifies complex ideas, writes codes, and answers just about anything under the Sun.\\n\\nJust like any other technology, the highly advanced AI-powered chatbots come with a cost, especially GPT-4. However, now, it seems there is an opportunity for more people to try their hands at GPT-4, and that too for free. New York-based software development company, Forefront AI, launched Forefront Chat. The latest tool allows users to access GPT-4 for free.\\n\\nApart from GPT-4, users can also try image generation, custom personas, shareable chats, and more on the platform. Users can pick from a wide range of personas that can assist them with various tasks. The tool comes with a Plus button in the input box that allows one to toggle between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.\\n\\nToday we’re launching Forefront chat—a better ChatGPT experience—in free alpha. Sign up to get free access to GPT-4, image generation, custom personas, shareable chats, and much more: https://t.co/lqsY9bkvl8 pic.twitter.com/CLht1pmQCn — Forefront (@ForefrontAI) April 21, 2023\\n\\nThe login is fairly simple, one simply needs log on to chat.forefront.ai, create an account either with an email id or an existing Google account. We tried the web application on both desktop and mobile browsers, and it worked wonderfully.\\n\\nAlthough the website has not given any instructions on how to create images, it has shared a video on its Twitter handle about the tool in which it was shown that the user was using a hashtag followed by imagine (#imagine) as a prefix to prompts for image creation. We also used prompts such as #Imagine yellow Taj Mahal, #Imagine Batman as Indian, and #Imagine a visual representation of India’s population. The images were not of great quality, but they pretty much summed their corresponding prompts.\\n\\nImages generated by Forefront Chat from prompts such as #Imagine a visual representation of India’s population, #Imagine Batman as Indian, and #Imagine yellow Taj Mahal. Images generated by Forefront Chat from prompts such as #Imagine a visual representation of India’s population, #Imagine Batman as Indian, and #Imagine yellow Taj Mahal.\\n\\nBesides, we also checked regular ChatGPT and Forefront.AI chat side by side, and both worked at a similar pace. The LinkedIn profile of Forefront AI lists Jimmy Greaser, Michael Tuck, and Carson Poole as the cofounders of the company. It is to be noted that the company has not shared any other details related to the tool.\\n\\nGPT-4, which stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4, is the latest iteration of San Francisco-based OpenAI’s large language model in the GPT series. It is essentially a multimodal large language model claimed to be faster, more efficient, and more powerful than GPT-3. At present, GPT-4 is accessible to only users who have subscribed to ChatGPT Plus, a premium service offered by the company.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOpenAI claims that GPT-4 can generate captions, classifications, and analyses of any topic. It can handle 25,000 words of text, allowing it to create extended conversations. The company has also claimed that its latest model will produce a less factually inaccurate response. OpenAI has also claimed that GPT-4 is better than humans on numerous standardised tests.\n",

Since then, it has passed the US Medical Licensing Exam and a Wharton MBA Exam. So is there anything that it can’t do better than humans? Yes, accounting as it turns out.\\n\\nIn a study published in the journal American Accounting Association, researchers put GPT 4-based ChatGPT to the test with accounting exam questions.\\n\\nThe study had 327 co-authors from across 186 institutions in 14 countries contributing 25,181 classroom accounting exam questions. They also recruited undergraduate students to feed another 2,268 textbook test bank questions to the chatbot.\\n\\n“When this technology first came out, everyone was worried that students could now use it to cheat. But opportunities to cheat have always existed. So for us, we’re trying to focus on what we can do with this technology now that we couldn’t do before to improve the teaching process for faculty and the learning process for students. Testing it out was eye-opening,” said lead study author David Wood, a professor of accounting at Brigham Young University (BYU), in a press statement.\\n\\nAlso read | Solar Orbiter gets closer to answering mystery of why Sun’s atmosphere is hotter than surface\\n\\nAccording to BYU, ChatGPT’s performance was impressive but students performed better. Students going on the test scored an overall average of 76.7 per cent compared to ChatGPT’s score of 47.7 per cent.\\n\\nChatGPT did score higher than the student average on 11.3 per cent of the questions, doing very well in the subjects of accounting information systems and auditing. But the AI bot did worse on tax, financial and managerial assessment. This could be because it struggled with the mathematical processes required for those subjects.\\n\\nAlso, when it comes to question type, ChatGPT did better when it came to true or false questions and multiple-choice questions. But it struggled with short-answer questions. The chatbot did worse on higher-order questions. Interestingly, it even provided authoritative written answers that were incorrect.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut despite this, the study authors believe that GPT-4 will perform much better on accounting exams, solving the issues that the previous version of ChatGPT struggled with.\n",

                                                                              John Schulman cofounded the ambitious software company OpenAI in December 2015, shortly before finishing his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. At OpenAI, he led the reinforcement learning team that developed ChatGPT — a chatbot based on the company’s generative pre-trained (GPT) language models — which has become a global sensation, thanks to its ability to generate remarkably human-like responses.\\n\\nDuring a campus visit on Wednesday, Berkeley News spoke with Schulman about why he chose Berkeley for graduate school, the allure of towel-folding robots, and what he sees for the future of artificial general intelligence.\\n\\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nBerkeley News: You studied physics as an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology and initially came to UC Berkeley to do a Ph.D. in neuroscience before switching to machine learning and robotics. Could you talk about your interests and what led you from physics to neuroscience and then to artificial intelligence?\\n\\nJohn Schulman: Well, I am curious about understanding the universe, and physics seemed like the area to study for that, and I admired the great physicists like Einstein. But then I did a couple of summer research projects in physics and wasn’t excited about them, and I found myself more interested in other topics. Neuroscience seemed exciting, and I was also kind of interested in AI, but I didn’t really see a path that I wanted to follow [in AI] as much as in neuroscience.\\n\\nWhen I came to Berkeley in the neuroscience program and did lab rotations, I did my last one with Pieter Abbeel. I thought Pieter’s work on helicopter control and towel-folding robots was pretty interesting, and when I did my rotation, I got really excited about that work and felt like I was spending all my time on it. So, I asked to switch to the EECS (electrical engineering and computer sciences) department.\\n\\nWhy did you choose Berkeley for graduate school?\\n\\nI had a good feeling about it, and I liked the professors I talked to during visit day.\\n\\nI also remember I went running the day after arriving, and I went up that road toward Berkeley Lab, and there was a little herd of deer, including some baby deer. It was maybe 7:30 in the morning, and no one else was out. So, that was a great moment.\\n\\nWhat were some of your early projects in Pieter Abbeel’s lab?\\n\\nThere were two main threads in [Abbeel’s] lab — surgical robotics and personal robotics. I don’t remember whose idea it was, but I decided to work on tying knots with the PR2 [short for personal robot 2]. I believe [the project] was motivated by the surgical work — we wanted to do knot tying for suturing, and we didn’t have a surgical robot, so I think we just figured we would use the PR2 to try out some ideas. It’s a mobile robot, it’s got wheels and two arms and a head with all sorts of gizmos on it. It’s still in Pieter’s lab, but not being used anymore — it’s like an antique.\\n\\nAs a graduate student at Berkeley, you became one of the pioneers of a type of artificial intelligence called deep reinforcement learning, which combines deep learning — training complex neural networks on large amounts of data — with reinforcement learning, in which machines learn by trial and error. Could you describe the genesis of this idea?\\n\\nAfter I had done a few projects in robotics, I was starting to think that the methods weren’t robust enough — that it would be hard to do anything really sophisticated or anything in the real world because we had to do so much engineering for each specific demo we were trying to make.\\n\\nAround that time, people had gotten some good results using deep learning and vision, and everyone who was in AI was starting to think about those results and what they meant. Deep learning seemed to make it possible to build these really robust models by training on lots of data. So, I started to wonder: How do we apply deep learning to robotics? And the conclusion I came to was reinforcement learning.\\n\\nYou became one of the co-founders of OpenAI in late 2015, while you were still finishing your Ph.D. work at Berkeley. Why did you decide to join this new venture?\\n\\nI wanted to do research in AI, and I thought that OpenAI was ambitious in its mission and was already thinking about artificial general intelligence (AGI). It seemed crazy to talk about AGI at the time, but I thought it was reasonable to start thinking about it, and I wanted to be at a place where that was acceptable to talk about.\\n\\nWhat is artificial general intelligence?\\n\\nWell, it’s become a little bit vague. You could define it as AI that can match or exceed human abilities in basically every area. And seven years ago, it was pretty clear what that term was pointing at because the systems at the time were extremely narrow. Now, I think it’s a little less clear because we see that AI is getting really general, and something like GPT-4 is beyond human ability in a lot of ways.\\n\\nIn the old days, people would talk about the Turing test as the big goal the field was shooting for. And now I think we’ve sort of quietly blown past the point where AI can have a multi-step conversation at a human level. But we don’t want to build models that pretend they’re humans, so it’s not actually the most meaningful goal to shoot for anymore.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, one of the main innovations behind ChatGPT is a new technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, humans help direct how the AI behaves by rating how it responds to different inquires. How did you get the idea to apply RLHF to ChatGPT?\\n\\nWell, there had been papers about this for a while, but I’d say the first version that looked similar to what we’re doing now was actually a paper from OpenAI, “Deep reinforcement learning from human preferences,” whose first author is actually another Berkeley alum, Paul Christiano, who had just joined the OpenAI safety team. The OpenAI safety team had worked on this effort because the idea was to align our models with human preference — try to get [the models] to actually listen to us and try to do what we want.\\n\\nThat first paper was not in the language domain, it was on Atari and simulated robotics tasks. And then they followed that up with work using language models for summarization. That was around the time GPT-3 was done training, and then I decided to jump on the bandwagon because I saw the potential in that whole research direction.\\n\\nWhat was your reaction when you first started interacting with ChatGPT? Were you surprised at how well it worked?\\n\\nI would say that I saw the models gradually change and gradually improve. One funny detail is that GPT-4 was done training before we released ChatGPT, which is based on GPT-3.5 — a weaker model. So at the time, no one at OpenAI was that excited about ChatGPT because there was this much stronger, much smarter model that had been trained. We had also been beta testing the chat model on a group of maybe 30 or 40 friends and family, and they basically liked it, but no one really raved about it.\\n\\nSo, I ended up being really surprised at how much it caught on with the general public. And I think it’s just because it was easier to use than models they had interacted with before of similar quality. And [ChatGPT] was also maybe slightly above threshold in terms of having lower hallucinations, meaning it made less stuff up and had a little more self-awareness. I also think there is a positive feedback effect, where people show each other how to use it effectively and get ideas by seeing how other people are using it.\\n\\nThe success of ChatGPT has renewed fears about the future of AI. Do you have any concerns about the safety of the GPT models?\\n\\nI would say that there are different kinds of risks that we should distinguish between. First, there’s the misuse risk — that people will use the model to get new ideas on how to do harm or will use it as part of some malicious system. And then there’s the risk of a treacherous turn, that the AI will have some goals that are misaligned with ours and wait until it’s powerful enough and try to take over.\\n\\nFor misuse risk, I’d say we’re definitely at the stage where there is some concern, though it’s not an existential risk. I think if we released GPT-4 without any safeguards, it could cause a lot of problems by giving people new ideas on how to do various bad things, and it could also be used for various kinds of scams or spam. We’re already seeing some of that, and it’s not even specific to GPT-4.\\n\\nAs for the risk of a takeover or treacherous turn, it’s definitely something we want to be very careful about, but it’s quite unlikely to happen. Right now, the models are just trained to produce a single message that gets high approval from a human reader, and the models themselves don’t have any long-term goals. So, there’s no reason for the model to have a desire to change anything about the external world. There are some arguments that this might be dangerous anyway, but I think those are a little far-fetched.\\n\\nNow that ChatGPT has in many ways passed the Turing test, what do you think is the next frontier in artificial generalized intelligence?\\n\\nI’d say that AIs will keep getting better at harder tasks, and tasks that used to be done by humans will gradually fall to being able to be done by a model perfectly well, possibly better. Then, there will be questions of what should humans be doing — what are the parts of the tasks where the humans can have more leverage and do more work with the help of models? So, I would say it’ll just be a gradual process of automating more things and shifting what people are doing.\n"

This is a significant improvement over ChatGPT, which required the user to prompt it again to keep going.\n",
